# learn language

the idea of this project is to create a tool to learn a new language
I will use the flak card system to learn 1,000 words using the theory of
the curve of oblivion, and spatial repetitions. I will present 5 words a day on a specific topic
If you study 5 words a day you will end up in 6 and a half months learning a thousand more words.
used in a language that you are learning you will be able to have simple conversations and understand a large part of the vocabulary that
is spoken daily.

## how will it work?
in 3 point of the day you will be presented with the words
* the first time it will only be the word with its translation
  * will use the words in an example to show how you can use that word this example will not have a translation
* the second time only the words
* the third you will have to write it in the language you are learning

after a day the learned word will be saved in a list of words that you have already learned where you will be able to see when you predicted it times that you have used it again and other statistical data to facilitate the memorization of that word see which one you can practice
## how to achieve that goal?

One way to do it is by automating the process of searching for words and examples using those words, making the words to learn appear daily without forgetting one day.
